* QR Generator API
Done as part of the project phase for Zuri Training.

Most of the stuff here (well REST and CRUD isn't) might seem... a bit
advanced but the secret is I have been RTFMs...

Ah well, This README will contain documentation (ugh... I hate it but I got
plans to rebuild this API with nestJs but there are failsafes if this
file looks meh).

** Packages and Dependencies Used

** TBA
