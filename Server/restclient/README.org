* RESTClient Testing
API testing file. Done using [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]] (in case you are wondering).
API is built as a part of the project phase for Zuri.

** Deadlines
- Milestone 3 <2022-12-11 Sun>
- Milestone 4 <2022-12-17 Sat>

** Tools used
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]]
- [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][restclient package for emacs]]

** API Tests
In case you know how to use (and view) Org files, what I have done is
self-explanatory but if not, keys are as follows;

- +TODO - yet to be done/done but buggy and needs finetuning.+
- +DONE - complete and tested(refer to the restclient file to see the
  API test routes).+
- +PRIORITY - Letters A to C, highest to lowest priority.+

Default to using checkmarks to show successful API tests.

*Note*: Regex is used for password patterns. Do make sure to add a
warning/friendly reminder to users on characters and min-length to
use when choosing their next password.

Rest of the functionalities will be added as I build the API.
